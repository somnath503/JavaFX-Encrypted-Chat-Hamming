JavaFX Encrypted Chat with Hamming(7,4) Error Correction
This is a basic client-server chat application built using JavaFX. It combines RSA encryption for secure messaging and Hamming(7,4) Error Correction Code (ECC) to detect and fix single-bit errors during transmission.

The goal of this project is to help you understand how encryption and error correction can work together in a real-time messaging system.

âœ¨ Key Features
Client-Server Chat â€“ Connect to a server and chat with other users.

Group & Private Messages â€“ Send messages to everyone, or privately using @username.

RSA Encryption â€“ Messages are encrypted on the client side using the server's public key and decrypted by the server using its private key.

Hamming(7,4) ECC â€“ Adds error correction to the encrypted message, allowing the system to fix single-bit errors automatically.

Simulated Errors â€“ A random 1-bit error is added on purpose to show how ECC fixes it.

JavaFX User Interface â€“ A simple and clean UI for sending and viewing messages.

Message Details â€“ Each message can be expanded to show how it was encrypted, encoded, corrupted, corrected, and finally decrypted.

Maven Build System â€“ Uses Maven to handle building and running the project easily.

Hamming(7,4) Error Correction

ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Clone the Project
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaFX-Encrypted-Chat-Hamming.git
cd JavaFX-Encrypted-Chat-Hamming
2. Build the Project
bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean compile
3. Start the Server
In the project folder, run the server with:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.somnath.server.Server"
Leave this terminal open. It means the server is running and ready to accept clients.

4. Start a Client
In a new terminal window (same folder), run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean javafx:run
A JavaFX window will open. Enter your username to join the chat.

5. Add More Clients (Optional)
To test with more users, repeat step 4 in new terminal windows.

ðŸ’¬ How to Use
Type your message and press Enter or click the Send button.

To send a private message, type:
@username your message here
